## Data Processing


```r
# keep the chatter down so the write-up stays clean
options(warn = -1)

# make sure we have access to the knitr library for setup and housekeeping
# suppressWarnings should not be necessary since we have used the warn option
# but using it to reinforce the idea that we want to keep the write-up clean.
suppressWarnings(library(knitr))

# set knitr default option values, specifically echo, turning on the cache and
# setting its location, and specifying the figure directory
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
               cache = TRUE, 
               cache.path = "cache/", 
               fig.path = "figure/")
